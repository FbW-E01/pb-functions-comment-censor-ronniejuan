# Print out censored comments

You are writing a comment censoring feature for a young childrens website.

Below there are three arrays of comments. Go through each comment in each array of those comments, printing out each comment - but replace the banned words with good words. Important: replace both uppercase and lowercase versions, so `HECK` should be replaced with `H**k` and `heck` should be replaced with `H**k`.

## Word replacements

- Heck => H**k
- Feck => F*ck
- Darn => Heckn'
- Assassin => WooohooWoohooin
- Dude => Friendo
