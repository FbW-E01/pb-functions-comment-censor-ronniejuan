// # Print out censored comments

// You are writing a comment censoring feature for a young childrens website.

// Below there are three arrays of comments. Go through each comment in each array of those comments, printing out each comment - but replace the banned words with good words. Important: replace both uppercase and lowercase versions, so `HECK` should be replaced with `H**k` and `heck` should be replaced with `H**k`.

// ## Word replacements

// - Heck => H**k
// - Feck => F*ck
// - Darn => Heckn'
// - Assassin => WooohooWoohooin
// - Dude => Friendo

//## Test data

  ,"In contrast, there is little theoretical analysis or experimental study of memes."
  ,"However, this is not the whole story, and individual differences in susceptibility to particular memes may reflect differences in genotype and development."
  ,"Unfortunately, computer music memes are not replicating and spreading themselves much further than narrow technically specialised audiences."
  ,"Isn't it simpler to posit that selection is taking place not at the level of groups of individuals, but at the level of memes themselves?"
  ,"We agree with most of this, although we prefer not to use language that implies that memes are independent living entities."
  ,"In this way, memes introduce new selectional forces and new kinds of variation into the cultural evolutionary process."
  ,"The minds are habitats of the memes, and they are certainly limited in their capacity."
